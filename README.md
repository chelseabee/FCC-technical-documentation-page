Honestly this was not the most fun/ interesting project for me personally. I kind of hurried through this style-wise. I did however use the time to learn about HTML tables, and elements of a navbar. The navbar gave me a few troubles, but I actually really enjoy finding out how to make those little technical difficulties work.
